# Hacksmiths Committee Handbook

Welcome to the Hacksmiths Committee. This document provides an outline of the expectations, structure and processes which we use to deliver our projects. If you have any questions, message our President - Kevin. Over time, this document may change or grow over time.

## Platforms we use

* Hacksmiths HQ, based on Airtable, is the home for our team profiles, project details, finances and sponsorship details.
* Airtable also contains our credentials to login to other accounts.
* Private Facebook Group, to discuss things in a more informal setting.
* Google Drive, to store files between one another.

When you join, you will be added to all of these platforms. More detail about Hacksmiths HQ is below. 

## Structure

The Executive Committee is made up of four roles:

* The President, who is elected by members. They oversee the society and Project Owners.
* The Treasurer, who is elected by members. They look after finances.
* The Secretary, who is elected by members. They look after administration.
* The Diversity & Inclusion Officer, who is appointed by the President, Treasurer and Secretary. They ensure our projects are inclusive, and work to make our society more diverse overall.

Everybody else is a General Committee Member. They are given support by the Executive Committee and empowered to become Project Owners for projects they are interested in running (they may already exist, or they may be proposed as new projects).

### Committee meetings

Once a week, the Executive Committee will meet and make sure that they are across all of the projects being run. At these meetings, they will discuss projects, resourcing and sponsorship. Once a month, the entire committee will meet to discuss progress and make desicions. 

All dates for monthly committee meetings for the 2017-2018 academic year are already set and you are expected to be at all of them. If you can't make it, please contact our Secretary before the meeting to make apologies. If you miss two meetings in a row, we will check that you still have time to be in the committee. If you miss three in a row - we will discuss whether you should be removed from the committee. By setting out all of these dates for the year, we hope you can make plans around them.

## Our values 

1. The most important thing is clear, honest and open communication. Even if you don't know how to complete a task, want help, or are struggling and need to take a break. If you tell the executive committee, they can provide more support or resource to your project.
2. We are for everyone - whatever background or skills our members may have, we want to provide environments for them to play with technology, learn and have fun. We aren't just for computer scientists.
3. We listen to people's needs and try to facilitate them. We are flexible in our approach - whether we're running a workshop, an event, or something else. If we know ahead of time that people's needs differ, we must consider this when planning.
